Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Missing and Invalid Values: Replaced placeholders like -999, -100, and NaN with descriptive labels such as "Don't Know," "Did Not Consent," or "Refused to Answer."

Interviewer Impact:

Average bill amounts were calculated based on interviews conducted by different personnel, providing insights into potential biases or anomalies.
Visualizations:
Bar Charts: Used to display average loan amounts by reasons and income sources.
Histograms: Illustrated the distribution of bill amounts across households.
Pie Charts: Highlighted the proportion of households classified under different BPL statuses.
Tools and Techniques:
